Privacy Policy for "Bring Back Maps" Chrome Extension

The "Bring Back Maps" Chrome extension does not collect, transmit, or store any user data. The extension only operates locally on the user's device.

The extension uses the "activeTab" permission to access the URL of the current tab when the user performs a location-related search on Google. This allows the extension to detect if the search is location-based and then inject the "Maps" tab back into the search results.

No data from the user's device is sent anywhere over the internet. All processing and functionality of the extension occurs entirely within the user's browser.

If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy practices of this extension, please contact us at [hello@builtbylukas.dev]
